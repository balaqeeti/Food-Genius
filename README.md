# Food Genius

## _A Restaurant Food Location app_

### How to use

Using Food Genius is very simple! First, when you see a record button, tap it and say a genre of food you would like to eat. **Be Careful**, the Genius records everything you say! If the verification box displays excessive words just hit the 'X' box (Not 360) and start over.

If the verifcation box displays a food genre that you want ("Mexican"), tap the check box and a map will display restaurants carrying that food on their menus!
